CHILD_CARE-cw3-{d1}=We hope you are finding motherhood good&are trying to get some rest.Are U breastfeeding? Do U have painful breasts?Its common as breasts try to make the right amount of milk for baby.Don't give up,it will soon be easier.Feed baby when they want to eat&they should be feeding at least 10times through a day&night.Don't be afraid to wake baby for feeding in order to release pressure in your breasts.Breastmilk ALONE is best for a healthy baby.*From Mobile Midwife*.
CHILD_CARE-cw4-{d1}=Newborns only need a few things to be happy.Food,love,sleep&a clean nappy.Changing baby's nappy often is important-bacteria in urine&faeces can make skin sore&give rashes.This happens very quick in warm weather.Expect to change nappy before or after every feed.This should every 1-3hrs.Baby is well fed if you change 6-10 nappies/day.Clean baby's buttocks with soft,damp,clean cloth&be sure to wash hands with soap after every change*From Mobile Midwife*.
CHILD_CARE-cw5-{d1}=Germs cause disease&infection for baby.The best way to keep germs from causing a problem for baby is by washing your hands. Wash with soap or ash&water rubbing them well. Always wash hands before holding or feeding baby, after changing nappies&after toileting,before cooking or eating&after touching uncooked meat,chicken or fish.Don't be afraid to tell others to wash their hands before holding or touching your new baby.It will go far in keeping baby healthy
CHILD_CARE-cw6-{d1}=Immunization protects baby from certain diseases.It is usually given by injection.Immunization tells the body to make antibodies, like soldiers to fight off disease.This week baby needs immunization against 5 of the childhood killer diseases.Go to CHPS for the injection.Even an immunized baby can still fall sick from other problems. Take baby to clinic if baby has fever,is breathing very hard or fast,not sucking at the breast,is limp,weak,or coughing.
CHILD_CARE-cw7-{d1}=U need to go to PNC to be sure U are fine after giving birth.At clinic it is important to talk with doctor about family planning.Getting pregnant again too quick is dangerous for your health.Breastfeeding may keep your period away for some time,but U will be fertile before you see your period return and U can get pregnant.Use a family planning method that is good for U to give your body time to recover&to be strong enough to carry a next pregnancy.
CHILD_CARE-cw8-{d1}=Baby is growing very fast&should gain about 1kg a month.At clinic the nurse will weigh&measure baby to be sure he is growing well.Baby should also be getting stronger now.He can not hold his head up well yet,but can watch things close to his face.He now also looks to see where voices or noise are coming from.If baby is not getting stronger,not sucking well at the breast,coughing or vomiting with force,or not breathing easy take baby to clinic straight.
CHILD_CARE-cw9-{d1}=Most 9wk old babies wake up in the night to feed&also play.When baby wakes U must give breastmilk to help her grow.Don't give tea or any other drink.Breastmilk is all baby needs until 6mos of age.When sleeping,be sure the matress is firm.Baby only needs a light covering,so coverings don't wrap around head or neck&baby is not too warm.If U are warm then so is baby.Baby must be protected from malaria by sleeping under insecticide treated mosquito net.
CHILD_CARE-cw10-{d1}=This week baby needs another immunization injection to protect them from the childhood killer diseases.Taking baby to clinic gives U chance to ask any questions about how baby is doing.U can get help with breastfeeding if needed.Baby should still only drink breastmilk as it gives baby everything needed to grow strong&stay healthy.Do not give any solids as baby's belly is not ready to manage them yet.Give breastmilk alone until 6 mos of age.
CHILD_CARE-cw11-{d1}=Having children too close together is dangerous for your health.U have the risk of bleeding too much on the next delivery,which can lead to death.Breastfeeding stops your period from coming but U can get pregnant.U will be able to get pregnant before U see your period so it is important to use family planning to give your body time to recover from this pregnancy.Some years between your children also gives time to prepare financially for the next baby.
CHILD_CARE-cw12-{d1}=Ghana weather is hot most of the time.Babies can overheat easily&it is very dangerous.If baby gets a rash on neck,under arms,or near edge of nappies,it is a rash to tell you that baby is to warm.Keep baby cooler by dressing in loose,light,cotton clothes.If U think baby is overheated,touch the skin.Damp hot skin is a sign baby is too warm.Make sure baby drinks plenty of breastmilk to keep from getting dehydrated,but dont give water or minerals.
CHILD_CARE-cw13-{d1}=This week see how baby moves arms&legs.Smoother&more gentle.Give baby space to strech&move arms&legs.Put baby down on clean mat&let move her freely.This helps make muscles stronger.Help her learn by holding a toy&see if she will reach&pick it.When baby is on the belly she should start to push off with the legs.All babies grow at their own pace but baby should be moving legs&arms very well or maybe she is not well.If U are not sure take baby to clinic to see.
CHILD_CARE-cw14-{d1}=This week your baby needs another immunization injection to protect them from the childhood killer diseases. Immunizations are free under NHIS.After injection baby may cry a lot or show a small rash.Make sure to breastfeed frequently so he will feel fine soon.But if baby is very warm (fever),vomiting with force,not breathing well or coughing with force it is a sign that baby is sick&needs to see the doctor straight away.Take him before it is too late.
CHILD_CARE-cw15-{d1}=Diarrhoea kills babies by draining liquid from the body causing dehydration.Send baby to clinic if she passes 3 or more watery stools in a day.Don't give baby anything but breastmilk unless told to by the doctor.Minerals,water or traditional medicines can make the sickness worse.Breastfeed often to replace lost fluids.Keep baby safe from diarrhoea sickness by putting all faeces from baby in a latrine,toilet or buried.Always wash hands before touching baby.
CHILD_CARE-cw16-{d1}=When babies get cough,cold or catarrh it can be serious.If not treated it can turn to pneumonia which can be deadly for baby.If baby has fever,cough,stuffed nose take him to the clinic.Baby should not take more than 50 breaths in 1 minute.If baby breathes faster take him to clinic.If the lower part of baby's chest sucks in as he breathes it is serious&baby needs to see the doctor.Prevent pneumonia&coughs by keeping baby away from tobacco&cooking fire smoke.
CHILD_CARE-cw17-{d1}=Best way U can keep baby safe from diarrhoea&other sickness is keep house area clean.When changing nappies,put faeces in latrine,toilet or bury.If U have washed faeces off nappies in a bucket,throw water far away from house,cooking areas&where children play.Babies put hands&anything they pick in their mouth.Wash baby's hands often&watch that baby doesn't pick rubbish from ground&put it in the mouth.Clean house&clean hands protect baby&family from sickness.
CHILD_CARE-cw18-{d1}=Malaria is dangerous for babies&if not treated right away can cause death.Do everything possible to protect from mosquito bites.Baby must sleep under insecticide treated mosquito net.In eve&early morn cover baby well includ. feet&legs with light colored clothing.If baby has fever,is limp,weak,or doesn't eat,take them to clinic straight.Traditional medicine is not good for babies.Understand how to give medicines doctor gives&give the full course.
CHILD_CARE-cw19-{d1}=Smoke causes serious breathing problems for baby.Pneumonia&asthma can be caused by or made worse by smoke.Prevent breathing problems by keeping baby away from smoke.This includes tobacco smoke,cooking fires,burning rubbish&burning for land clearing.Baby's lungs&heart are developing&smoke damages them.If baby has catarrah,baby can stop breathing.If baby's chest or belly is sucking in as he breaths take him to clinic straight away before it is too late.
CHILD_CARE-cw20-{d1}=Baby is growing fast&getting stronger.When on her belly,she can stretch arms&legs&bend her back.She may sit up without help.Lifting head&chest up to see toys or your face helps make neck muscles strong&develops head control.Hold her under the arms while letting her balance feet on your lap&bounce up&down.She can put hands in her mouth.Be careful what she holds.Clapping hands for her or giving her something safe&clean to hold can be fun&help her learn&grow.
CHILD_CARE-cw21-{d1}=Baby may show signs he wants to eat real food but his belly is not ready to manage.Baby is eating enough,if making 6-8 wet nappies in a day&if baby takes to breast quick,eats well without crying,slipping off or falling asleep.If baby is gaining weight,healthy&seems happy after eating baby is probably doing well.Even if baby looks interested in food U are eating,breastmilk is all he needs until 6 months old.Giving anything else can make him very sick.
CHILD_CARE-cw22-{d1}=Baby may have 1st tooth now,but if not they are coming.Teeth come first,bottom front,then top two front,then rest.Teething pain can make baby a bit difficult.Signs of teething are red,swollen gums,rubbing one ear,not sleeping or feeding well,&wanting to bite or suck on anything that comes close to her mouth.Teething does not cause sickness.Fever or diarrhoea in baby is dangerous so even if U think it is teeth coming,take baby to clinic to be sure.
CHILD_CARE-cw23-{d1}=Rashes can be from nappies,heat or disease.Be sure baby received immunizations to prevent diseases.Reason for nappy rash is wetness.Best way to keep baby from nappy rash is dry clean buttocks.5 steps to help.Change baby's nappy as soon as possible after it becomes wet.Clean baby's genital area well after each bowel movement&allow it to dry b4 putting nappy back.?Don't fasten nappies to tight.?A small amount of shea butter works to protect&help heal rash.
CHILD_CARE-cw24-{d1}=Congratulations.Baby is 6 months.Little one should be growing well&should still be putting on weight.Baby might crawl.This month baby is to go to clinic.Doctor will check weight&height to see all is well.Babies are all different,but should be able to do some of the following; turn to sounds&voices,copy sounds heard,blow bubbles from mouth or roll over.Playing with baby is more fun as baby laughs&shows enjoyment.Singing a clapping song is fun for U both."
CHILD_CARE-cw25-{d1}=Baby is now ready for other foods along with breastmilk.Baby needs practice swallowing&feeding will take time&patience.Forcing or rushing baby leads to chocking&vomiting.Koko/porridge alone is not enough to make baby grow strong.Make koko rich by adding powdered fish or beans.Also add teaspoon of palm oil or groundnut paste.Make sure you boil food very well to kill germs that make baby sick.Feed 2times a day along with breastfeeding as much as baby wants.
